## God is Creator and Lord

God made us to know, love and serve Him. Jesus Christ, the eternal one, created all things and rules over all.

> *In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through Him all things were made, and without Him nothing was made that has been made.* &mdash; John 1:1-3, BSB

> *For in Him all things were created, things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities. All things were created through Him and for Him.* &mdash; Colossians 1:16, BSB

> *The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.* &mdash; Psalm 103:19, KJV

We owe our worship and obedience to Him alone. 

## God is Holy

God is perfectly holy and cannot approve evil. 

He calls us to be holy as He is holy.

## Mankind is Sinful

All have sinned.

What is sin? Sin is breaking the law. I John 3:4

What law? The commandments. Rom 7:7

God's commandments are righteousness, and all unrighteousness is sin. 1 John 5:17, Psa 119:172

Even if you only think it, you are still sinning. Matt 5:27-28

Though we try to do good deeds, we cannot please or reach God on our own.

## Sin Brings Death

All have fallen short of the glory of God and are guilty.

God's justice demands that the cost of sin must be paid for by death and eternal punishment.

We cannot save ourselves by good works or moral reform.

## Jesus, Lord and Savior

God who is rich in mercy and love for us sent His Son, Jesus Christ, who lived a righteous and perfect life and died in our place to pay for our sins and rose again.

His death satisfied God's perfect justice; His resurrection proves His victory over death and secures our salvation.

## Saving Faith

All who believe in Jesus have eternal life with Him.

True faith means turning away from our sin and trusting in Christ alone for eternal life.

It shows itself in obedience, understanding and love for Him.
