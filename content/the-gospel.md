***

The Gospel, meaning "Good News," is the transformative message of God's love, forgiveness, and hope through Jesus Christ. It is the Good News that offers eternal life to all who believe. Continue reading below to explore further insights into this powerful message.

## God, Lord and Creator

God made us to know, love and serve Him. Jesus Christ, the eternal one, created all things and rules over all.

> *In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through Him all things were made, and without Him nothing was made that has been made.*   
> &mdash; John 1:1-3, BSB

> *For by him all things were created in the heavens and on the earth, visible things and invisible things, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things have been created through him and for him.*   
> &mdash; Colossians 1:16, WEB

> *The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.*   
> &mdash; Psalm 103:19, KJV

We owe our worship and obedience to Him alone. 

> *But take care that your hearts are not turned to false ways so that you become servants and worshippers of other gods*   
> &mdash; Deuteronomy 11:16, BBE

> *"Away from Me, Satan!" Jesus told him. "For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your God and serve Him only.'"*   
> &mdash; Matthew 4:10, BSB

## God is Holy

God is perfectly holy and cannot approve evil. 

> *Let no man say when he is tempted, “I am tempted by God,” for God can’t be tempted by evil, and he himself tempts no one.*   
> &mdash; James 1:13, WEB

> *And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.*   
> &mdash; Isaiah 6:3, KJV

He calls us to be holy as He is holy.

> *Because it has been said in the Writings, You are to be holy, for I am holy.*   
> &mdash; 1 Peter 1:16, BBE

> *For I am the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt so that I would be your God; therefore be holy, because I am holy.*   
> &mdash; Leviticus 11:45, BSB

## Mankind is Sinful

All have sinned.

> *Therefore, as sin entered into the world through one man, and death through sin, so death passed to all men because all sinned.*   
> &mdash; Romans 5:12, WEB

> *As it is written, “There is no one righteous; no, not one. There is no one who understands. There is no one who seeks after God. They have all turned away. They have together become unprofitable. There is no one who does good, no, not so much as one.”*   
> &mdash; Romans 3:10-12, WEB

> *If they sin against thee, (for *there is* no man that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near*   
> &mdash; 1 Kings 8:46, KJV

What is sin? Sin is breaking the law. 

> *Everyone who is a sinner goes against the law, for sin is going against the law.*   
> &mdash; 1 John 3:4, BBE

What law? The commandments.

> *What then shall we say? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Indeed, I would not have been mindful of sin if not for the law. For I would not have been aware of coveting if the law had not said, “Do not covet.”*   
> &mdash; Romans 7:7, BSB

God's commandments are righteousness, and all unrighteousness is sin. Even if you only think it, you are still sinning. 

> *All unrighteousness is sin...*   
> &mdash; 1 John 5:17(a), WEB

> *Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.*   
> &mdash; Matthew 5:27-28, KJV

> *Let my tongue make songs in praise of your word; for all your teachings are righteousness.*   
> &mdash; Psalm 119:172, BBE

Though we try to do good deeds, we cannot please or reach God on our own.

> *The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt; their ways are vile. There is no one who does good.*   
> &mdash; Psalm 53:1, BSB

## Sin Brings Death

All have fallen short of the glory of God and are guilty.

> *Yahweh, the God of Israel, you are righteous; for we are left a remnant that has escaped, as it is today. Behold, we are before you in our guiltiness; for no one can stand before you because of this.”*   
> &mdash; Ezra 9:15, WEB

> *For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God*   
> &mdash; Romans 3:23, KJV

> *For anyone who keeps all the law, but makes a slip in one point, is judged to have gone against it all.*
> &mdash; James 2:10, BBE

God's justice demands that the cost of sin must be paid for by death and eternal punishment.

> *Behold, every soul belongs to Me; both father and son are Mine. The soul who sins is the one who will die.*   
> &mdash; Ezekiel 18:4, BSB

> *For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.*   
> &mdash; Romans 6:23, WEB

> *But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.*   
> &mdash; Luke 12:5, KJV

> *Whose reward will be eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his strength*   
> &mdash; 2 Thessalonians 1:9, BBE

We cannot save ourselves by good works or moral reform.

> *Therefore no one will be justified in His sight by works of the law. For the law merely brings awareness of sin.*   
> &mdash; Romans 3:20, BSB

## Jesus, Lord and Savior

God who is rich in mercy and love for us sent His Son, Jesus Christ, who lived a righteous and perfect life and died in our place to pay for our sins and rose again.

> *Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring you to God, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the Spirit*   
> &mdash; 1 Peter 3:18, WEB

> *But God, being rich in mercy, for his great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved*   
> &mdash; Ephesians 2:4-5, WEB

> *[W]hom God raised up, having freed him from the agony of death, because it was not possible that he should be held by it.*   
> &mdash; Acts 2:24, WEB

His death satisfied God's perfect justice; His resurrection proves His victory over death and secures our salvation.

> *God made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God.*  
> &mdash; 2 Corinthians 5:21, BSB

> *He did this to demonstrate His righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and to justify the one who has faith in Jesus.*   
> &mdash; Romans 3:26, BSB

> *[T]hat if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.*   
> &mdash; Romans 10:9, BSB

## Saving Faith

The Good News is this: *All who believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, have eternal life with Him.*

> *For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.*   
> &mdash; John 3:16, KJV

> *For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.*   
> &mdash; 1 Corinthians 15:22, KJV

> *There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.*   
> &mdash; Romans 8:1, KJV

True faith means turning away from our sin and trusting in Christ alone for eternal life.

> *No, I tell you. But unless you repent, you too will all perish.*   
> &mdash; Luke 13:3, BSB

> *And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true—in His Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.*   
> &mdash; 1 John 5:20, BSB

It shows itself in reverence, understanding and love for Him.

> *[F]or by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, that no one would boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared before that we would walk in them.*   
> &mdash; Ephesians 2:8-10, WEB

> *If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we lie and don’t tell the truth. But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son, cleanses us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us the sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.*   
> &mdash; 1 John 1:6-9, WEB

> *My little children, I write these things to you so that you may not sin. If anyone sins, we have a Counselor with the Father, Jesus Christ, the righteous. And he is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world. This is how we know that we know him: if we keep his commandments. One who says, “I know him,” and doesn’t keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth isn’t in him. But God’s love has most certainly been perfected in whoever keeps his word. This is how we know that we are in him: he who says he remains in him ought himself also to walk just like he walked.*   
> &mdash; 1 John 2:1-6, WEB

## Responding in Faith

Jesus Christ, invites us to go to Him. In Him alone we find rest and salvation for our souls.

> *Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.”*   
> &mdash; Matthew 11:28-30, BSB

> *Everyone the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will never drive away. For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but to do the will of Him who sent Me. And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that I shall lose none of those He has given Me, but raise them up at the last day. For it is My Father’s will that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in Him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.*   
> &mdash; John 6:37-40, BSB

If you're ready to trust in Jesus and accept His gift of salvation and eternal life with Him, know that He is always listening and ready to receive you. 

> *The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.*   
> &mdash; Psalm 69:32, KJV

The prayer below is simply a guide, an example of how to begin your relationship with Jesus. It's not about the words themselves, but the sincerity of your heart. Feel free to make this prayer your own and speak to Him in your own words, knowing that He hears you.

> *Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heart and life. I want to trust and follow You as my Lord and Savior. In Your Name. Amen.*
