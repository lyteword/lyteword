We now have the Holy Bible, or the book, because "bible" means book. We call it the book because it is the best book ever written. It's the most important book, like the sun in the sky, while other good books are like the moon and stars, getting their light from it. We call it the holy book because it was written by holy people, and inspired by the Holy Spirit. It is completely true and free from any lies or bad intentions. Its main goal is to help people live good and holy lives.

The big ideas about God’s law and message are written in the Bible so that they would be clearer, last longer, and spread farther. This way, they could reach people in different places and times without losing their meaning. We should be careful not to ignore these important teachings, since they were given to us in a clear and lasting way. The Bible includes all the writings of holy people, from Moses to St. John, who shared God’s message. The Bible is now complete, and we have it in our hands, making it the most perfect guide we can have here on Earth. Every part of it is good, and together, it is very good. This is the light that shines in a dark place (2 Peter 1:19). Without the Bible, the world would be a much darker place.
