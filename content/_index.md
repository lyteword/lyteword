## The Mission of the Gospel

The mission of the Gospel is the joyful proclamation of the Good News of Jesus Christ—truth that transforms hearts, renews minds, and calls people into new life with God. From the earliest days of the Church, this message has been preserved, defended, and explained through faithful theological works written to strengthen believers and to bear witness to the truth of Christ to the world. We are committed to restoring historic Christian works not as relics, but as living testimonies to enduring Gospel truth—refined and made accessible for today’s readers.
