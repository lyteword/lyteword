## The Mission of the Gospel

> *And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.* &mdash; John 3:14-17, KJV.

We are passionate about revitalizing these works—many of which have been left to history—to serve both the spiritual growth of believers and the mission of sharing the Gospel. 

> *Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey all that I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, even to the end of the age.* &mdash; Matthew 28:18-20, BSB.

Our goal is not only to help Christians grow in their walk with God but also to make these resources available to those who are seeking truth and desiring to know Jesus Christ more deeply.
