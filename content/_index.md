## The Mission of the Gospel

The mission of the Gospel is the joyful proclamation of the Good News of Jesus Christ—truth that transforms hearts, renews minds, and calls people into new life with God. From the earliest days of the Church, this message has been preserved, defended, and explained through faithful theological works written to strengthen believers and to bear witness to the truth of Christ to the world.

> *For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.* &mdash; John 3:16-17, KJV.

We are passionate about revitalizing these works—many of which have been left to history—not as relics of the past, but as living testimonies to enduring Gospel truth. By restoring, refining, and making them accessible, we seek to serve both the spiritual growth of believers and the ongoing mission of sharing the Gospel across generations and cultures.

> *Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey all that I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, even to the end of the age.* &mdash; Matthew 28:18-20, BSB.

Our goal is not only to help Christians grow in their walk with God, but also to make these resources available to those who are seeking truth and desiring to know Jesus Christ more deeply. Whether read for devotion, study, or honest inquiry, these renewed works exist to point beyond themselves—to the glory of God and the life-giving hope found in the Gospel.
